# XConfess Deployment

This repo deploys as two apps plus managed services:

- `xconfess-backend`: NestJS API on port `5000`.
- `xconfess-frontend`: Next.js app on port `3000`.
- PostgreSQL: required.
- Redis: required when `ENABLE_BACKGROUND_JOBS=true`..

## Local Smoke Start

From the repo root:

```powershell
npm install
docker compose up -d postgres redis
npm run dev:backend
npm run dev:frontend
```,

Backend liveness:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:5000/api/health/live -UseBasicParsing
```

Backend readiness:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:5000/api/health/ready -UseBasicParsing
```

If Docker says the `dockerDesktopLinuxEngine` pipe does not exist, start Docker Desktop and make sure it is using Linux containers.

## Production Environment

Never deploy the local `.env` values. Generate real secrets and put them in your hosting provider's secret manager.

Required backend variables:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
APP_ENV=production
PORT=5000
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain
BACKEND_URL=https://your-backend-domain

```

Staging uses the same shape with staging hosts and isolated staging databases:

```env
NODE_ENV=production
APP_ENV=staging
PORT=5000
FRONTEND_URL=https://staging.your-frontend-domain
BACKEND_URL=https://staging.your-backend-domain
DB_HOST=staging-postgres-host
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USERNAME=staging-app-user
DB_PASSWORD=staging-db-password
DB_NAME=xconfess_staging
JWT_SECRET=staging-strong-secret
APP_SECRET=staging-strong-secret
CONFESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY=64-hex-characters
TYPEORM_SYNCHRONIZE=false
TYPEORM_MIGRATIONS_RUN=true
ADMIN_ACTION_APPROVAL_TTL_MINUTES=30
ENABLE_BACKGROUND_JOBS=true
REDIS_HOST=staging-redis-host
REDIS_PORT=6379
```

Admin confession deletion now requires an independent second-admin approval.
Deploy the backend migration before enabling the new API flow, leave
`TYPEORM_SYNCHRONIZE=false`, and set `ADMIN_ACTION_APPROVAL_TTL_MINUTES` to an
integer from 5 through 1440 (default 30). Pending requests are marked expired
automatically by the backend scheduler; approval and cancellation endpoints
also enforce expiry immediately.

Required frontend variables:

```env
BACKEND_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://your-backend-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-frontend-domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_CONTRACT_ID=CB5XMDHT66EISB4WXM4YGNDHYRMZDX42TOHZEAENIUTSSMRFHJSFRNHB
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_BYPASS_AUTH=false
```

Generate backend secrets:

```powershell
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(48).toString('base64'))"
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Use the base64 values for `JWT_SECRET` and `APP_SECRET`. Use the 64-character hex value for `CONFESSION_ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

## Container Deployment

Build backend:

```powershell
docker build -f Dockerfile.backend -t xconfess-backend .
```

Build frontend:

```powershell
docker build -f Dockerfile.frontend -t xconfess-frontend `
  --build-arg BACKEND_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain/api `
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend-domain/api `
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=wss://your-backend-domain `
  --build-arg NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-frontend-domain .
```

Start the backend only after Postgres and Redis are reachable. The backend exposes `/api/health/live` for process health and `/api/health/ready` for dependency readiness.

## SSH/PM2 Deployment Order

Deploy backend first, then frontend.

1. Sync `xconfess-backend`.
2. Write the backend `.env`.
3. Run `npm ci --omit=dev`.
4. Restart `xconfess-backend` with PM2.
5. Verify `http://localhost:5000/api/health/ready` on the server.
6. Sync `xconfess-frontend`.
7. Run `npm ci --omit=dev`.
8. Restart `xconfess-frontend` with PM2.

The CD workflow follows this order and stops before frontend deployment if backend readiness fails.

## Rollback Runbook

Find the last successful deployment:

```powershell
gh run list --workflow cd.yml --status success --limit 10
```

Roll backend back first by rerunning CD against the previous known-good commit SHA, or by SSHing into the host and restoring the previous `~/xconfess/backend/dist` directory.

```powershell
gh workflow run cd.yml --ref <previous-good-sha> -f environment=production -f run_build=true
```

After the backend is restored, verify readiness:

```powershell
ssh <deploy-user>@<deploy-host> "curl -sf http://localhost:5000/api/health/ready"
```

Then roll frontend back to the matching commit or restore the previous `~/xconfess/frontend/.next` directory. Smoke check public routes after PM2 reload:

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://your-frontend-domain -UseBasicParsing
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://your-frontend-domain/login -UseBasicParsing
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://your-frontend-domain/register -UseBasicParsing
```

## CI/CD Gates

Fast deploy gate for app hosts:

```powershell
npm run ci:apps
```

Full repo gate:

```powershell
npm run ci
```

The full gate includes frontend type-checking, frontend tests, backend tests, and Rust contract tests. Contract tests need enough free disk space for the MSVC linker on Windows.

`npm run deploy:preflight` checks Render config drift, migration timestamp duplicates, and required production env vars. It now also runs automatically as a required GitHub Actions check (`Deploy Preflight`) on every pull request against `main`, using dummy production-shaped env values — no live secrets are needed for the check to run.

## Contract Release Compatibility Report

Before promoting any contract release, generate the pre-release compatibility report:

```powershell
npm run check:abi-drift
npm run contract:test
```

The report combines ABI diffs, the on-chain storage version, migration requirements, and deployment manifest differences. Interpret it as follows:

- **Blocking conditions** (any of these stops the release): ABI drift without a matching version bump, a storage version change with no registered migration, a manifest diff for a contract ID that is not part of the release, or a failed migration rehearsal.
- **Non-blocking warnings**: additive ABI entries, documentation-only manifest changes, and storage version bumps that ship with a rehearsal fixture.
- Attach the generated report to the release PR. A release without an attached report is not approved.

## Contract Storage Migration Rehearsal

Upgrades must be rehearsed against representative prior-version state fixtures before release:

```powershell
npm run contract:test
npm run contract:build:release
```

Operator sequence:

1. Run the rehearsal suite against the prior-version fixtures. It applies the migration to a snapshot of deployed state and asserts the post-migration layout.
2. Confirm the rollback constraints documented by the rehearsal (which fields are forward-only and cannot be reverted).
3. Only after a green rehearsal, build the release artifact and proceed with deployment.
4. If a rehearsal fails, do not deploy. Fix the migration or add a fixture that reproduces the failure.

## Indexed Event Range Verification

The event verifier is read-only and compares indexed ranges against ledger data:

```powershell
npm run contract:test:integration
```

- It reports gaps grouped by checkpoint so operators can see exactly which ranges were missed or misclassified.
- Bounded reprocessing is opt-in and requires an explicit range. Never reprocess unbounded ranges in production.
- Reprocessing is idempotent: re-indexing an already-indexed range must not duplicate events. If it does, stop and escalate before continuing.

## Ambiguous Transaction Submission Recovery

When a submission times out, the caller must not blindly retry. The backend records a durable pending state keyed by operation intent:

1. On timeout, look up the pending record by operation intent before retrying.
2. If the record shows the operation landed, treat the submission as successful and do not resubmit.
3. If the record is still pending, retry with the same operation intent so the reconciliation lookup converges instead of duplicating tipping or anchoring.
4. If reconciliation cannot resolve the intent, escalate; do not issue a fresh intent.

```powershell
npm run backend:test
npm run contract:test:integration
```
## Transaction Latency and Failure Budgets

Transaction workflows are instrumented at the backend boundary with bounded labels so application latency can be separated from network-provider latency:

- `network`: one of `stellar-testnet`, `stellar-mainnet`, `stellar-futurenet`, `stellar-custom` (never a raw URL or passphrase).
- `operation`: one of `submit`, `include`, `confirm`, `anchor`, `tip`, `badge`.
- `outcome`: one of `success`, `timeout`, `provider_error`, `rejected`.

Each submission records three latency samples: submission (request accepted by the provider), inclusion (transaction observed in a ledger), and confirmation (final success/failure). Budgets are configured per network and operation class:

```env
TX_LATENCY_BUDGET_SUBMIT_MS=5000
TX_LATENCY_BUDGET_INCLUDE_MS=30000
TX_LATENCY_BUDGET_CONFIRM_MS=60000
TX_FAILURE_BUDGET_PERCENT=5
TX_BUDGET_WINDOW_SECONDS=300
```

When a budget is exceeded, the backend emits a structured warning (`tx_budget_exceeded`) with the bounded labels and the observed value. Budgets are advisory by default; set `TX_BUDGET_ENFORCE=true` to reject new submissions for a network/operation class once its failure budget is exhausted within the window. Rejections return `503` with `code: "TX_BUDGET_EXHAUSTED"` and are counted under `outcome=rejected`.

Operational notes:

- Budgets are evaluated over a rolling window and reset on process restart; they are not a substitute for provider-side alerting.
- Never add unbounded labels (transaction hashes, account IDs, raw URLs) to these metrics.
- Tune budgets per network; mainnet confirmation budgets are typically higher than testnet.

## Wallet Authorization Scopes

Wallet-connected actions map a user intent to exactly one contract operation and an explicit authorization footprint. The frontend declares the intent before signing; the backend and contract integration tests verify the signed invocation matches it.

| Intent | Contract operation | Authorization footprint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `create_confession` | `anchor_confession` | `invoke` on the confession anchor contract only |
| `send_tip` | `transfer_tip` | `invoke` on the tipping contract; token transfer limited to the tip amount |
| `mint_badge` | `mint_badge` | `invoke` on the reputation badges contract only |

Rules enforced at the boundary:

- The requested footprint must be a subset of the declared intent's allowed footprint. Unexpected authorization requirements (extra contracts, admin functions, unbounded token approvals) are rejected before the wallet prompt is shown.
- The displayed intent (operation, contract, amount) must match the signed invocation; mismatches fail closed with `code: "AUTH_SCOPE_MISMATCH"`.
- Authorization failures are surfaced to the user without retrying automatically.

Contributors adding a new wallet action must add the intent to the scope map, document it in this table, and cover both the expected path and the rejection path in `npm run frontend:test` and `npm run contract:test:integration`.

## Deployment Configuration Drift Contract

Render (backend) and Vercel (frontend) must agree on a checked, non-secret configuration contract. `npm run production:readiness` compares the safe values below across both targets and fails readiness on drift:

- API origins: `BACKEND_URL` (Render) must equal the origin of `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` and `BACKEND_API_URL` (Vercel).
- WebSocket origin: `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL` must use `wss://` and share the backend host.
- Cookie settings: `COOKIE_SECURE=true`, `COOKIE_SAME_SITE` consistent with the frontend/backend origin relationship, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` matching the frontend origin.
- Feature flags: `STELLAR_FEATURES_ENABLED` (backend) must match `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_FEATURES_ENABLED` (frontend).
- Network selection: `STELLAR_NETWORK` must match `NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK`, and the contract IDs must match across targets.

Only non-secret values are compared; secrets are never read or logged. On drift, readiness fails with a per-field report naming the field, both observed values, and remediation, for example:

```text
CONFIG_DRIFT NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK: vercel="mainnet" render="testnet"
  remediation: set NEXT_PUBLIC_STELLAR_NETWORK=testnet in Vercel and redeploy the frontend
```

Remediation guidance:

1. Fix the drifted value in the owning provider's environment settings.
2. Redeploy the affected app (frontend changes require a rebuild because `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined).
3. Re-run `npm run production:readiness` and confirm it passes before promoting.

## Regional Synthetic Checks

Privacy-critical user flows are exercised by low-volume synthetic journeys from multiple regions. Checks use synthetic accounts and fixtures only — never real user data — and report per-step availability with bounded labels:

- `region`: deployment region identifier (for example `us-east`, `eu-west`, `ap-southeast`).
- `step`: one of `landing`, `login`, `create_confession`, `view_confession`, `health`.
- `outcome`: one of `success`, `failure`, `timeout`.

Configuration:

```env
SYNTHETIC_CHECKS_ENABLED=true
SYNTHETIC_CHECK_REGIONS=us-east,eu-west,ap-southeast
SYNTHETIC_CHECK_INTERVAL_SECONDS=300
SYNTHETIC_CHECK_TIMEOUT_MS=10000
SYNTHETIC_CHECK_BASE_URL=https://your-frontend-domain
```

Operational notes:

- Keep volume low (one journey per region per interval) to avoid skewing real traffic metrics.
- Synthetic accounts are isolated and cleaned up; they must not be able to read or write real confessions.
- A failing step in any region fails the synthetic readiness report with the region and step named; regional routing, TLS, and edge-cache failures surface here before users report them.
- Roll out by enabling one region first, confirming a clean run, then adding regions incrementally.

Validation: `npm run readiness:test` covers the expected path, per-step failure reporting, and the regression risk of unbounded labels or real-user data leaking into synthetic journeys.
